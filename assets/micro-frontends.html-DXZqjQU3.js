One of these challenges is logging. Within a micro-frontend architecture you will have multiple apps that are able to injected into the parent application without the parent application needing to know much about how the child application implements their features. In order to prevent chaos within the parent app, child apps typically remove all of their logs before packaging for the parent application. This keeps the browser console clean. The downside to this however is that you may need to capture some logs in production and react to them. Removing them leaves you helpless in this regard.</p>',7),d=r('<h3 id="example-architecture" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#example-architecture"><span>Example Architecture</span></a></h3><h3 id="explanation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#explanation"><span>Explanation</span></a></h3><p>Within the dev environment of each of your child applications you can interact with a GlobalStore.
