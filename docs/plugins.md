# Official Plugins

The following list contains plugins that are officially supported by core Adze contributors and are
maintained under the [`@adze` npm organization namespace](). We hope that over time this list will
grow and hopefully community created add-on's can be adopted by the official organization.

<!-- ## @adze/transport-cloudwatch-logs

This project is a plugin for the Adze logging library to transport log data to AWS CloudWatch Logs.

This library exposes a log listener factory for setting up log groups and streams in CloudWatch Logs. It can be configured to automatically create the group or stream if it does not already exist.
